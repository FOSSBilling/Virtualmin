# Virtualmin Server Manager for FOSSBilling

This repository is for the Virtualmin server manager for FOSSBilling.
This server manager is currently unmaintained and does not function correctly. If you use Virtualmin and are a developer, we'd appreciate it if someone could assist in getting it functional again & maintain it.

## Installation
1. Download the `Virtualmin.php` file from the source code
2. Copy the downloaded `Virtualmin.php` file to `/library/server/manager/Virtualmin.php`in your FOSSBilling instance.
